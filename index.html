Do you need a computer?
============================================================================================

![](https://needcomputer.org/needcomputerorg.jpg)

I would like to give you a computer. I don't know who you are, or how you might use the computer. Maybe you want to make music, or money or play games to past the time. Whatever it is, I'm here to help out. I also want to show you how to fix computers. I can't always give a computer out, but maybe I can help you learn how to fix one. And from that, you obtain a working computer at a low cost or make some money from your skills. 

Why do you do this?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of NeedComputerOrg is to educate and provide computers to those in need. Not everyone has access to a quality computer or knows how to fix them when they break. In the world today, the labor cost outweighs buying a new computer and this is often what lcoal repair shops and retailers capitalize of. Instead, I want to empower you and others around you to have the tools and knowledge to work on computers and fix them. Or give you a computer, if you need one.

How do I request a computer? (or give one away)

Dontations are made both from and to viewers. In order for this whole operation to succeed, we require the use of recycled machines and other hardware that is given to us. We take broken/working materials and use it to educate and equip you. We also partner with businesses that upgrade their machines and have unused equipment they want to pass along.
